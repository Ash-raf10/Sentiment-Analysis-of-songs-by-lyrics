In this world of you people,
at every step, a human is wrong..
whatever I feel is right and say,
you call it wrong, if I'm wrong then who's right?

Should I send you a request
for me to live with my own wish?
means you all have a right on me
more than I do..
(it's) my right, put it here (give it to me)

Our right,
Right here!
Our right, keep it here!
Our right, keep it here!

hey,
in these queues,
or in credits,
why do you choke my habit of living..

I am mannerless,
I am from that street,
where there is no shame..

Heart says that..
customs are compensation (like a fee here) for living,
this world is enemy n all belongs to someone else..
burn them..
heart says..
heart says..
to live by the heart, or die...

O Eco Friendly,
O saver of nature,
I am nature too..

From customs,
from societies,
why
do you cut me off..
why do you divide me like that?

Why do you teach the lesson of truth
when you cannot even listen to the truth,
when someone speaks the truth
you start telling (giving) rules and regulations..

your fear,
your love,
your praise..
you only keep..
keep them, damn it!
