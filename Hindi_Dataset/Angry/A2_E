Make a sieve of my chest (with bullets),
Shoot me with all the bullets, today I want to,
My wish is, to die..
I want to die today, I want to die..

Make it tough for me to live,
And still I'll die happily, that's what I wish,
I want to die today..

O my Lord, someday call me
To your home, your door,
And give me any pains that are still remaining (for me to bear)
Make me cry badly, that's what I want..

Today I want,
I want, want today
To see you once,
I'm ready to be cut a million times,
I wish to die today..

I'd take your demons, your problems,
And give you blessings..
Take, take this time
These breaths have now lost..
