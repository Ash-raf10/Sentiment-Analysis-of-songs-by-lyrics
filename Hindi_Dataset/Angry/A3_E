O beloved why are you angry
The rogue world is a liar

I walked miles alone
I am unable to solve the puzzle
My friends have become strangers

I wake up while sleeping
Feels like you have touched my body
I am in your talks, burning like a lamp

When you come home and I see you
When you come home and I see you
I hug you
Lover why are you angry
Helpless world is lying
Lover why are you angry
Helpless world is lying

The day goes in request
Even the nights pass in your memories
(Our) strings got connected such, that getting adorned
I lost myself
pickling in the chest,
scorching in living,
how to tell about the yearning
O Krishna, you forgot your promise,
How Do I live..
