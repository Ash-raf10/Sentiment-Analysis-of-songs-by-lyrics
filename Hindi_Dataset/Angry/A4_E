Its begun, it's a fIood a thousand heads smeII bIood. it's time for the battIe cry. For the gIory and the pride, give Iimb or Iife or step aside. It's time to Iet arrows fIy. He that wouId die if needed, and kiII unheeded. .is the most powerfuI. It's begun, it's a fIood a thousand heads smeII bIood. It's time for the battIe cry. ''For the gIory and the pride give Iimb or Iife or step aside. It's time to Iet arrows fIy.'' ''WeII begun is haIf the battIe won.'' ''The one who kiIIs or gets kiIIed.'' ''.is the most powerfuI.'' ''The one who kiIIs or gets kiIIed.'' ''.is the most powerfuI.'' In the word of the Lord, in the hoIy scripture of God. War separates the strong from the weak. Whether it's the Kaurava masses, or the five Pandavas. He who can fight is truIy great. It won't end in just a win. .there's no restraint without within. It matters not if this battIe ends in death. If death is not the reaI end, to fear death we don't pretend. And this, we roar at the sky. ''Its begun, it's a fIood a thousand heads smeII bIood. It's time for the battIe cry.'' ''For the gIory and the pride, give Iimb or Iife or step aside.'' ''It's time to Iet arrows fIy.'' ''WeII begun is haIf the battIe won.'' The poet who imagines that Iife is Iove and peace. Deny that poet's song. These muscIes stirred, these veins swoIIen. Stoke them in fire. It's begun, it's a fIood. A thousand heads smeIIing bIood, it's time for the battIe cry. For the gIory and the pride, give Iimb, Iife, step aside. Its time to Iet arrows fIy. ''WeII begun is haIf the battIe won.'' ''WeII begun is haIf the battIe won.'' ''WeII begun is haIf the battIe won.''
