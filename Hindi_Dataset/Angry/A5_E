If you rise your head it will be chopped,
where will you hide, where will you save yourself,
Every place is ambushed, chequer of death is spread everywhere,
if you getup, you'll fall, if you fall, you'll be chopped,
if you hide, you'll be caught, if you'll got caught you'll die,
wake up wake up, run run, if you can save yourself today save yourself...
this is storm, this is earthquake, it's running on full force...
who has the guts to fight, who can keep himself standing...

the most adamant, the most powerful,
designed by the weapons, this is my blood-character...
blood-character (5)

I dream of night, I dream of day, I dream of watching you flee away,
fear once, fear me twice, fear me more I'll shoot you aside...
You gotta keep running if you want to survive,
coz everynight I dream of watching you die...
dum da da dum, this is the dance of death...

dance dance whole night, you may not know if you'll be there tommorow...
beat the drum, beat it with your hands and feet...
dance dance on my fingers, dance dance whole night,
I am the serpant of the death, my dagger sounds like drums...
