In the arms of the Sun, there is life now
There are sunrays in our breaths, there’s light (a glow) in our talks
In the arms of the Sun, there is life now
There are sunrays in our breaths, there’s light in our talks

As the tempo of the heart has changed
I just thought of this
We get only one chance to live
Then why shouldn’t we love it (life) openly (greatly)
What are we waiting for?
As life is this only and it is here itself

Till yesterday what was a desire
You and me have achieved it today
Let us hold hands like this only
And roam around the city
All day and all night long
Happiness is surely residing somewhere

In the arms of the Sun, there is life now
There are sunrays in our breaths, there’s light in our talks
In the arms of the Sun, there is life now
There are sunrays in our breaths, there’s light in our talks

In which I can weave new dreams, I’ll only call that life, a real one
In which I can choose new roads, I’ll only call that life, a real one
The one which is always dancing and enjoying is actually a true life
