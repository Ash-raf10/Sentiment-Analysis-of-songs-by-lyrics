mood is full of love,
I have to go home in the evening,
what a magic you have done..

the moment is pleasing,
we don’t have to waste time,
have the fun of life, O friend..

then take my pic,
take my pic,
take my pic, O beloved.

it’s a town of dreams,
the night is brown too,
what has happened? nothing..
she’s just two drinks down.

I am not intoxicated,
the weather itself is intoxicating.
even if I drink water,
it feels like tequila.
