neither there are those soulful eyes anywhere,
nor that illuminated face anywhere.
there are no talks of heart anywhere,
nor is that beautiful youth anywhere else.

I have roamed around the world and there is no one like you.

neither there is that romantic smile anywhere,
nor is there that lovely fragrance anywhere.
there are no such colorful charms anywhere,
nor is there that lovely innocence anywhere.
remain as you are..

you are the wet greenery of the rainy seasons,
you are that redness that comes on the cheeks in winters.
you are the peace of nights and morning prayer
I have held you in the sheets of affections.

sometimes you burn like a fire,
and sometimes you are rainwater
sometimes you agree with me silently,
and sometimes you do only what you wish.
remain as you are..

in my fate or in the talks of courage
in all the gifts of joy and sorrows.
I want to keep you with me, you have to be with me,
in my world, and in my emotions too.

somewhere I find your souvenir,
which I have to show to everyone.
you know that even after dying
I know how to fulfil (my promise, my love).
what is said is to be done.
