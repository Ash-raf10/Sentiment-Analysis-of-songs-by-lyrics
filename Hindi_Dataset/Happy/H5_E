You’re here, I’m here too, Come closer, then so I can tell You
Why did I become crazy for You in just an instant

You're the one I saw, You're the one I got acquainted to
Whatever sense I had, it's gone away now
The scent of Your body, is awakening some magic
My heart got out of control and lost itself

You're the one I thought about, You're the one I accepted
You're the one I saw, You're the one I got acquainted to
Whatever sense I had, it's gone away now

Why are You so beautiful
That everyone is amazed
That, on Earth there resides a girl, sweeter than the fairies
Yes, tell me why are You so gorgeous
Whoever sees You, become quiet
Look at me, I’m also lost and intoxicated, on me also there is a hold of craziness
You're the one I worshipped, You’re the one I wished to have
You're the one I saw, You're the one I got acquainted to
Whatever sense I had, it's gone away now
The scent of Your body, is awakening some magic
My heart got out of control and lost itself

You're the one I saw, You're the one I got acquainted to
Whatever sense I had, it's gone away now

You’re here, I’m here too, Come closer, then so I can tell You
When You looked at me, who knows what's happened
Who knows why I remain lost in thoughts
Neither awake nor asleep
Now there are desires in my heart, a storm in my breatht, and in my eyes there's a moonlight of my dreams
Yes, who knows why my mind is intoxicated
My body is fragranced 
I walk saucily, flirtatiously, bashfully, swaying like some melody
Now that I have understood You, now that I’ve recognized You
You're the one I saw, You're the one I got acquainted to
Whatever sense I had, it's gone away now

The scent of Your body, is awakening some magic
My heart got out of control and lost itself

You're the one I saw, You're the one I got acquainted to
