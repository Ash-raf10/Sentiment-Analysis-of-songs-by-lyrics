Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
How gorgeous is this world
Forget all the mess
And see the fair of flowers
Badi Rangeen Hai Yeh Duniya
This world is really colorful

Brother
This road is telling me something now
That you are about to meet someone somewhere...
Why is my heart so restless
Whom am I about to meet
The thing I had been wishing for, since I don't know when
Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
Life is a vehicle, and time its wheel
There are rivers of tears
And also gardens of happiness in it
Everyone has been waiting for you, my brother
Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
How gorgeous is this world
Wherever I gaze, on these roads
Colors melt in my sight
The wind is cool
And so is the shade
Don't know whose village is it, that is far away
How did these clouds appear
And where to, the heart has taken me
What kind of dream has it shown me
Every dream feels real
If the light of love is lit
And if you walk the road
That is your mind telling you to
From the shells of every moment
You will pick only the pearls
If you listen only
To what your mind is telling you
Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
How gorgeous is this world
Forget all the mess
And see the fair of flowers
This world is really colorful
It feels like the heart has become very light
Like when a heavy weight is removed from shoulders
Like innocent childhood has come back again
Like someone takes a dip in the river Ganges in a long time
It feels like this mind is washed up
And all worldly bonds have loosened up
Life seems very pure to me now
There is love in life
There are songs on lips
This is the only victory you can get, listen up oh traveler
In whatever direction you head, give away just love
And light only lamps, listen up oh traveler

Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
Who is it that calls me now
Rivers, mountains, lakes and waterfalls
Jungles and valleys
What are the signals they give

Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
How gorgeous is this world
Forget all the mess
And see the fair of flowers
This world is really colorful
This road is telling me something now
That you are about to meet someone somewhere
Brother
Keep walking the way you do, oh traveler
How gorgeous this world is
