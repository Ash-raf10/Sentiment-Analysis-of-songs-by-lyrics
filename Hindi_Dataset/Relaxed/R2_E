O, this travelogue,
travel narrative of questions,
begins from you, ends at you,
this travelogue..

that, for which I searched through the world,
that was in me only..
that, the travel narrative of
all my answers..
from my side, the first step is taken towards you,
we shall meet..

travelogue
of thoughts,
travelogue,
of lights in darkness.
time such that is old,
and new too.
a travelogue
of the examples of love..
