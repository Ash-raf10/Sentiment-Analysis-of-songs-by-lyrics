May the heart share its convoluted talks/thoughts with me also 
Then it will be an act of benevolence
It will be an act of benevolence
May it understand it first itself and then make me understand
Then it will be an act of benevolence
It will be an act of benevolence

It will be an act of benevolence if the heart promises
To tell me what it hasn’t ever said
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine

If we keep on meeting in this way
May the evil eye of love not see us 
O deceiving/cheating heart! Why have You stopped beating
After having such wayward thoughts

Now it is not under my control
As the heart has come and stopped on You
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
As You are mine
It will be an act of benevolence

I complain and then I remember
I think about You again and again
There isn’t any love, yet why do I still desire
That You always be around me

There’s nothing, still there’s something
After meeting You, the heart feels
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
It will be an act of benevolence
As You are mine
