Evenings, as if they're mad,
nights like some tunnel..
I don't know why on rebel flights only,
O God, my heart comes..
O God, my heart is interested..

There is a question about tomorrow,
[as in, no one knows what happens tomorrow]
Living life is now.
I don't know why in nomadic ways only
I find my heart interested, O Lord,
my heart is interested..

My philosophy is - my bag is on my shoulders.
I go wherever the path takes me..
Not on the drops,
But the sea of drops itself..

O God, O God.. O God..
