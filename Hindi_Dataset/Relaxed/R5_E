Sunshine raining on water..
It creates shadows, removes them,
I call, and you come (for me), pacify me,
and every distance between us gets embarrassed
you're with me, and so, the days and nights are there,
(that is what these) shadows tell me..

you're with me, and so the days and nights are there,
every shadow (tells me), O beloved, O beloved..
In every thought/deed of mine, you're with me,
O beloved, O beloved..
You're all my situations
[that is, you're the reason of all my situations, and you're there in them all too. This is not explicitly said, but more of an implied meaning here.]
O beloved, O beloved..

you pester me, you cajole me, pester (again),
make me cry and make me laugh too.
O close one, every distance feels embarrassed

You're all my secrets, my tomorrow and today,
O beloved, O beloved..
You're every flight of mine..

This living, or even not living,
both are related to you only.
It's me only who is your address
there is no other way (to reach you)..
Whoever looks for you, should come to me only,
You speak in my silences,
This living, and not living too,
whatever has happened has happened from you alone.
