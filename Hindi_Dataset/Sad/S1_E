How do I tell,
Why I love you,
O friend, I'm unable to tell..
see, whatever talks of hearts
is remaining,
the eyes explain to you
you don't know..
you don't know..

Even after meeting, I didn't meet-
you, don't know why, of miles-
there are distances from u, don't know why,
unknown series (of say, links) are there,
attached to you, don't know why, dreams are there-
below the eyelids, because of you, don't know why..

that who's living (can say stuck) in my eyes,
that looks exactly like you,
I don't know whether your eyes or talks were the reason,
that you became the wish of heart,
you, even though near,
you, even though wished for,
even after being a feeling,
are not mine, why do I have such complaints,
against you, don't know why, of miles,
there are distances from u, don't know why,
you don't know..
you don't know..


o, don't know- don't know- don't know,
you don't know,
in thoughts millions of things (I)
said though,
Didn't say anything when in front of you,
You didn't get alienated even after being of someone else's,
see you didn't become mine either,
there is grief, the heart cries too,
it cherishes dreams, gone mad, it thinks
why I met you,
of miles there are distances from you,
unknown series are there,
attached to you, don't know why, dreams are there-
below the eyelids, because of you, don't know why..
