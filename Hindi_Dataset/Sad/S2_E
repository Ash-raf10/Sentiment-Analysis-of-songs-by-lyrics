My eyes got raining,
and even the dry dreams got wet (in tears),
My eyes got raining,
my sleep cries in the corners of eyelids,
My eyes got raining,
Tears fall and heart gets hurt
My eyes got raining,
(and) It's weather of separation's clouds,

With black, black, blank nights, I'm getting friends,
Lost in these ways, I have nothing my own,
Every moment, how I bear,
Every moment, to myself, I keep saying,
I have forgotten you,
I've forgotten you,
I've forgotten u,
Then why did your memories
make me cry,
make me cry..

The words written in your memories do I hear,
Passed moments ask why (we) got separated like that, God,
God, this distance (I've) got
God, it's your decision only,
God, it has happened,
that you had written..

For two moments I was attached to you,
Then the path was turned such
(that) I started getting lost from you
Like getting away
was something mine from me..

You only pray for me now,
You only part me from this pain now,
Being yours, when I did not remain yours,
I say this to myself,
I have forgotten you,
I've forgotten you,
I've forgotten u,
Then why did your memories
make me cry,
make me cry..
