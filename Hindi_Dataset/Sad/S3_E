Relationships,
these relationships...

My heart is so mindless,
the imaptient (heart) is an idiot,
how much it loves you,
it didn't understand itself.

Now someone make a case for
this pain of heart..
so that it gets that rain (of love)
that drenches it completely..

what such effect was there of being with you,
I don't know,
that there was no sense left in me..
my words stuck on my tongue,
but couldn't get spoken..
In my heartbeat there is your name alone,
and the eyes give this message too.
It's all effect of your sight
that is there on me..

As I found you,
my life has changed,
I have become all new,
all talks of world are ineffective..
Now I listen to you always,
I find excuses to meet you..
When you smile, I wish to be the reason,
(and wish) to spend all my day with you, everyday..
