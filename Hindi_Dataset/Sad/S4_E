Love melody is there Grief anger complaints are there
Stories are there, words are there
Love melody is there Grief anger complaints are there
Stories are there, words are there
Words and discussions are forgotten
Memories return keep coming back
Words and discussions are forgotten
Memories return keep coming back
These memories of beloved ones who are near to heart
Once they are gone died or left these memories keep coming back

Memories, memories and memories

My darling, my beloved this life is like the flowing water of river
Water flows away what remains after that

Memories, memories and memories

Love melody is there Grief anger complaints are there
Stories are there, words are there
Words and discussions are forgotten
Memories return keep coming back
These memories of beloved ones who are near to heart
Once they are gone died or left departed these memories keep coming back

Memories, memories and memories
Memories, memories and memories

In this world we all
Long for or depend on memories
Some happy moments little bit sadness or sad moments, sorrows
They belong to us and we belong them

Memories, Sweet memories

Bittersweet memories
Love melody is there Grief anger complaints are there
Stories are there, words are there
Words and discussions are forgotten
Memories return keep coming back
These memories of beloved ones who are near to heart
Once they are gone died or left departed these memories keep coming back
Memories, memories and memories
