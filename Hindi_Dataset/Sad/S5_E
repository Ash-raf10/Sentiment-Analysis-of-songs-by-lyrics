where I am,
wherever I be,
your memory remains with me...
whether I tell someone,
or not,
this thing that's in my heart.

as such, a world is there with us,
but hidden in the heart,
a loneliness grows...
just your memory is with me,

somewhere a spear goes
into the heart,
and sometimes all the pictures (in my memories)
get very much faded...
someone remains happy
in the new colors of a new world,
and someone, even after getting everything,
says in his heart that â€”

as such, a world is there with us,
but hidden in the heart,
a loneliness grows...
just your memory is with me,

somewhere, the roots of a past time
go down and make a place in the heart..
and somewhere, when threads break,
the beads all spread away..
someone keeps a place in the heart
for new things.
and some keep lamps of memories
on their eyelids.. (i.e. they keep their memories alive)
