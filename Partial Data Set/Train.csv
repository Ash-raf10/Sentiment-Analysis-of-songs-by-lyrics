I have seen death.Lived to see a lover's final breath.Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?And if you want to talk about it once again,On you I depend.

I have seen faith.Seen the look of anger on your face.And if you want to talk about what will be,Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,I'm a friend.And if you want to talk about it anymore,Lie here on the floorand cry on my shoulder once again,cry on my shoulder,I'm a friend."
